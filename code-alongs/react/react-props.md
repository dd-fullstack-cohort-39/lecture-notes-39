# React Props Snap Challenge

**Do this in your React Challenge Project.**

1. Create a new React component in frontend/src titled PropsSnapChallenge.js
2. Import and use this component in Home.js, About.js, Pizza.js or any other page view you choose.
3. Pass a value (string or number is simplest, try array or object for more of a challenge) to this component.
4. In this component, retrieve the value from props and add it to the jsx to display it in the DOM.
