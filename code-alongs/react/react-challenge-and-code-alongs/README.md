# React Challenge
## Objective
 * Reinforced practice of creating layouts in React using React-Bootstrap.
 * Using React Router to create synthetic routes in a SPA (Single Page Applications).
 * JSX trial by fire.
 * learning how to learn.
 ## Rules 
 1. Create a website that contains TWO PAGEs that successfully implements the layouts shown in the wireframes in the documentation directory. These pages should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
 2. Try to use React Bootstrap's built in components to the greatest extent possible and only use built in bootstrap classes as a fallback.
 3.  Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
 4. You can copy snippets from React-Bootstrap's Official Documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built templates, other websites, or existing projects! The challenge here is to create these pages from scratch using React Bootstrap and React Router.
 5. No need for CDN Links or installing other dependencies. This project includes all the dependencies you need to complete this assignment. Reference the Getting Started section for instructions on installing React and other dependencies. 
 **Code taken from the official Bootstrap documentation, React Bootstrap documentation, FontAwesome documentation, and Example Capstone repository is excepted.**
## Getting started
1. Clone down the repo from Github
2. cd in `/frontend` and run `npm install`
3. run `npm run start`
4. go to localhost:3000 in the browser to see the React application
